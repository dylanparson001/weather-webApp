Weather App

Specs From the odin project

This project uses the open weather API, the user enters their city, and uses the radio buttons to pick whether they want the weather in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
It is compiled and minified using webpack, each piece of functionality is assigned to their own module. Webpack also imports all of these modules in the correct order. 

This project also uses the SASS preprocessor, very little style is applied as of now. I want to make a more intricate design and implement it. As of now the project is fully functional, and does what I wanted to accomplish.
